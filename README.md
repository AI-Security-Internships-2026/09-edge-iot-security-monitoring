# Edge IoT Security Monitoring with Federated Learning

> **CNIT/PNTLab Pisa · TECIP · Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna — AI Security Internship 2026**

---

## Research Problem

Design a federated-learning framework for IoT edge nodes that collaboratively trains an intrusion detection model without transmitting raw sensor data to a central server.

---

## Objectives

1. Conduct a systematic literature review on the topic.
2. Design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype.
3. Evaluate the prototype on real or benchmark datasets.
4. Document findings in a final technical report.
5. Present results to the research group.

---

## Expected Deliverables

| Deliverable | Due |
|---|---|
| Literature review (`docs/literature-review.md`) | Week 2 |
| Architecture design document (`docs/proposal.md`) | Week 3 |
| Working prototype (`src/`) | Week 6 |
| Evaluation results (`experiments/results/`) | Week 7 |
| Final report (`docs/final-report.md`) | Week 8 |

## Recommended Technology Stack

```
Python, Flower (Flwr), PyTorch, MQTT, Pandas, Matplotlib
```

See `requirements.txt` for pinned dependencies.

---

## Weekly Workflow

```
Monday     – Review weekly tasks in tasks/week-XX.md
Tue–Thu    – Implementation / experiments
Friday     – Document progress in docs/weekly-progress.md
Friday     – Open weekly Pull Request from your branch → dev
```

---

## Branching Policy

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, supervisor-reviewed code only |
| `dev` | Integration branch — merge weekly PRs here |
| `<your-name>-week-XX` | Your working branch for each week |

**Students must never push directly to `main`.**

---

## Pull Request Policy

- One PR per week, targeting the `dev` branch.
- PR title format: `[Week XX] Brief description`
- PR description must reference the weekly task file and summarise what was done.
- A supervisor or co-student must review before merging.
